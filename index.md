**Project Ideas**  
[CO2 Emissions Data:](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ravindrasinghrana/carbon-co2-emissions)  
For this dataset I was thinking I could compare two countries C02 Emissions using the date columns. 

[S&P 500 Data:](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravmehta13/sp-500-stock-prices)  
For this dataset I could look at the stock prices of two tech companies like apple and microsoft and see how their price is correlated. I can do this by using the time series data. 

[Democracy Index:](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shreyasur965/democracy-index)  
It seems like the world has been trending more towards countries switiching to democracy, but I would like to test this theory and see if the world has become more democratic over time or not. I could also compare democracy ratings across countries.
