**Project Ideas:**<br>
[CO2 Emissions Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ravindrasinghrana/carbon-co2-emissions)  
For this dataset I was thinking I could compare two countries C02 Emissions using the date columns. 

[S&P 500 Data:](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravmehta13/sp-500-stock-prices)  
For this dataset I could look at the stock prices of two tech companies like apple and microsoft and see how their price is correlated. I can do this by using the time series data.
